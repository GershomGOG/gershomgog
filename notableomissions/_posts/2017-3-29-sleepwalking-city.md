It's a sleepwalking city<br />
Saving it's fight for another day<br />
It won't waste it on you<br />
It never wanted to waste it on you<br />

A helicopter circles,<br />
And the dogs circle bellow<br />
The same circles they drew as children<br />
The only circles they know<br />

And the children smile<br />
With a laugh and a giggle<br />
They see the end in sight<br />
That the rest of us can only make believe<br />

To believe in this city<br />
Is not to believe in anything<br />
To believe in everything<br />
It's a sleepwalking city<br />

To live in this city<br />
Is not to live anywhere<br />
Is to live everywhere<br />
It's a sleepwalking city<br />
