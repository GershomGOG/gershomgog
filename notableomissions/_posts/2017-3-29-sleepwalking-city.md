It's a sleepwalking city
Saving it's fight for another day
It won't waste it on you
It never wanted to waste it on you

A helicopter circles,
And the dogs circle bellow
The same circles they drew as children
The only circles they know

And the children smile
With a laugh and a giggle
They see the end in sight
That the rest of us can only make believe

To believe in this city
Is not to believe in anything
To believe in everything
It's a sleepwalking city

To live in this city
Is not to live anywhere
Is to live everywhere
It's a sleepwalking city
