I'm starting to put a series of photgraphs called "Delay" up on [@mohsregaragononnag](https://www.instagram.com/mohsregaragononnag/). They are all originally photos of people on their phones, some of them the earbuds and other details get hard to see, waiting around that are then turned into something like stencil art. I'd like to make them into stickers or stenicils or patches, but for now it is an instagram project.
